Tic-Stack-Toe
=============
This project is an Android game based on the board game Gobblet- a two player strategy game where players compete to get 4 in a row by placing and stacking pieces on the board.

It uses Google Play Game services to allow game play over the network- either in real-time or via turn-based play.
